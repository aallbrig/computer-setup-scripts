### Andrew Allbright's computer setup scripts
Here are my computer setup scripts, written using `ansible`. These help me quickly version control preferences on whatever computer I'm working on.

### First Time Installation
```bash
./first-install.sh
./run.sh
```

### Update
```bash
./run.sh
```

### Saving
Use `git`!
